Invoking External Contracts

Objective: To introduce students to invoking other smart contracts within NEO.

Task: Assign students to create a smart contract that interacts with an existing NEO contract. They should choose a well-known NEO contract (e.g., a NEO token contract) and develop a contract that interacts with it (e.g., transferring tokens). Students should submit their code, documentation of the interaction, and any challenges they encountered.

Instructions:

Step 1: Selecting an External Contract (10 points)

Instruct students to choose a well-established NEO smart contract to interact with. Examples include the NEO token contract or other widely used NEO-based contracts.
Encourage them to research and understand the chosen contract's functions and capabilities.
Step 2: Smart Contract Development (40 points)

Guide students in developing a new smart contract that interacts with the chosen external contract.
The interaction can involve tasks such as transferring tokens, querying balances, or invoking specific functions of the external contract.
Ensure that the students' contract code includes the necessary logic for interacting with the chosen external contract.
Step 3: Testing (20 points)

Instruct students to thoroughly test their smart contract on the NEO testnet.
Ask them to document their testing process and provide evidence of successful interactions with the external contract.
Encourage them to test various scenarios to ensure their contract works correctly.
Step 4: Documentation (20 points)

Request that students provide clear documentation of the interaction between their smart contract and the chosen external contract.
Encourage them to explain the purpose of their smart contract and the specific interactions they implemented.
Ask students to document any challenges they faced during development and testing and how they overcame them.
Grading Criteria:

Selection of a suitable external contract.
Successful development of a smart contract that interacts with the chosen external contract.
Evidence of thorough testing and successful interactions with the external contract on the NEO testnet.
Quality of the documentation, including explanations of the interaction and any challenges faced.
