Building a Decentralized Application (dApp)

Objective: To apply smart contract development skills to build a simple dApp on the NEO platform.

Task: Challenge students to build a basic decentralized application (dApp) on the NEO blockchain. The dApp should have a specific use case, such as a decentralized voting system, a token-based game, or any other creative idea. Students should create both the smart contract and, if applicable, a basic user interface (UI) to interact with the smart contract. They should submit the code, user instructions, and a brief description of their dApp's purpose.

Instructions:

Step 1: dApp Concept Selection (10 points)

Instruct students to choose a specific use case or concept for their decentralized application. Encourage creativity and innovation.
They should provide a clear and concise description of the dApp's purpose and functionality.
Step 2: Smart Contract Development (40 points)

Guide students in developing the NEO smart contract that powers their dApp.
Ensure that the contract includes all necessary functions and logic to fulfill the dApp's purpose.
Encourage code quality, readability, and documentation.
Step 3: User Interface (UI) Development (if applicable) (20 points)

If students choose to include a user interface for their dApp, guide them in developing a basic UI.
The UI can be a web-based interface or a command-line interface, depending on the complexity of the dApp.
Students should ensure that the UI is user-friendly and allows users to interact with the smart contract seamlessly.
Step 4: Testing and Deployment (20 points)

Instruct students to thoroughly test their dApp and smart contract on the NEO testnet.
They should provide evidence of successful testing, including interactions with the smart contract.
Ensure that students deploy their dApp on the NEO testnet and provide deployment instructions.
Step 5: User Instructions (10 points)

Ask students to provide clear and concise instructions on how users can interact with their dApp and smart contract.
Include details on how to access and use the dApp, including any required tools or software.
Grading Criteria:

Selection of an innovative and well-defined dApp concept.
Successful development of a NEO smart contract that powers the dApp.
Quality and usability of the user interface (if applicable).
Thorough testing and deployment on the NEO testnet.
Clarity and completeness of user instructions.
