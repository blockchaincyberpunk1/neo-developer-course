Contributing to NEO-Related Open Source

Objective: To encourage contributions to the NEO ecosystem and provide practical experience in open-source development.

Task: Assign students a small coding project or bug-fix related to NEO or a NEO-based open-source project. They should actively contribute to the project by forking the repository, making code improvements or bug fixes, and submitting a pull request (PR). Additionally, students should document their contribution process, including the problem they addressed and the steps they followed.

Instructions:

Step 1: Project Selection (10 points)

Provide students with a list of NEO-related open-source projects or repositories that have suitable beginner-friendly issues or coding tasks.
Allow students to select a project based on their interests and skill level.
Step 2: Contribution (50 points)

Instruct students to:
Fork the chosen open-source repository to their GitHub account.
Select a specific issue or task from the project's issue tracker.
Create a new branch for their work and make the necessary code changes to address the issue or task.
Ensure that their code adheres to coding standards and follows best practices.
Commit and push their changes to their forked repository.
Submit a pull request (PR) to the original project repository, describing the problem they addressed, the changes made, and any relevant information.
Step 3: Documentation (40 points)

Students should create detailed documentation of their contribution process, which includes:
An introduction explaining the open-source project they worked on.
A description of the specific issue or task they addressed, including its importance or relevance.
Step-by-step instructions on how they forked the repository, created a branch, and made code changes.
A description of the testing and quality assurance process they followed (if applicable).
A detailed explanation of how they submitted the pull request, including any challenges or lessons learned.
Screenshots or code snippets to illustrate their contributions (if applicable).
Grading Criteria:

Quality and significance of the contribution to the open-source project.
Adherence to coding standards and best practices.
Completeness and clarity of the documentation of the contribution process.
Submission of a meaningful pull request and active engagement with the project community.
Ability to address and resolve any feedback or review comments on the pull request.
