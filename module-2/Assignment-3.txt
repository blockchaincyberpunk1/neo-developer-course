NEO Smart Contracts Basics

Objective: To learn about smart contract development on the NEO platform.

Task: Guide students through the process of creating a simple NEO smart contract. Provide them with resources or development tools (e.g., NEO Visual DevTracker) to write and deploy a basic smart contract. Students should submit their smart contract code along with an explanation of its purpose and functionality.

Instructions:

Step 1: Introduction to NEO Smart Contracts (15 points)

Start by introducing students to the concept of smart contracts and their significance in blockchain technology.
Provide an overview of NEO's approach to smart contracts, focusing on its advantages and use cases.
Step 2: NEO Development Tools (15 points)

Introduce students to NEO development tools and resources, such as NEO Visual DevTracker or NEO Blockchain Toolkit.
Demonstrate how to set up the development environment and configure it for NEO smart contract development.
Step 3: Smart Contract Development (40 points)

Assign students the task of creating a simple NEO smart contract. It could be a basic token contract, a voting contract, or any other straightforward use case.
Provide guidelines on coding standards, best practices, and security considerations.
Students should write the smart contract code and include comments to explain the purpose and functionality of the contract.
Step 4: Deployment and Testing (20 points)

Instruct students on how to deploy their smart contracts to the NEO TestNet.
Encourage them to test the deployed contracts thoroughly to ensure they function as intended.
Students should document their deployment and testing process.
Step 5: Submission and Presentation (10 points)

Ask students to submit their smart contract code and a document that explains the contract's functionality, usage, and any notable features.
Optionally, students can present their smart contracts to the class, demonstrating how they work and discussing their design choices.
Grading Criteria:

Completion of a functional NEO smart contract.
Clarity and correctness of the smart contract code.
Thorough testing of the smart contract on the NEO TestNet.
Quality of the explanatory document.
Participation in the optional presentation.
