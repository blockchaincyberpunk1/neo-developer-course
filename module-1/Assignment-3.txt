Building a Simple Blockchain

Objective: To gain hands-on experience with basic blockchain development.

Task: Guide students through the process of creating a simplified blockchain using a programming language of their choice (e.g., Python). They should implement the core components, including blocks, transactions, and a basic consensus mechanism. Students should submit their blockchain code along with an explanation of how it works.

Instructions:

Step 1: Understanding Blockchain Basics (10 points)

Begin the assignment by providing a brief overview of blockchain technology, including its key components (blocks, transactions, consensus mechanisms).
Explain the importance of blockchain's immutability, security, and decentralized nature.
Step 2: Choosing a Programming Language (10 points)

Allow students to select a programming language for their blockchain implementation. Common choices include Python, JavaScript, and Java.
Step 3: Building the Blockchain (40 points)

Provide students with a basic blockchain structure to get them started. The structure should include blocks and transactions.
Instruct them to implement the following key features:
Block creation and chaining: Each block should have a unique hash based on its contents and the hash of the previous block.
Transaction mechanism: Allow students to create and add transactions to blocks.
Consensus mechanism: Implement a basic consensus mechanism (e.g., proof-of-work) to validate and add new blocks to the blockchain.
Step 4: Testing and Verification (20 points)

Encourage students to test their blockchain thoroughly. They should create a few sample transactions, mine blocks, and verify the correctness of their implementation.
Emphasize the importance of security and data integrity in their blockchain.
Step 5: Documentation and Explanation (20 points)

Instruct students to provide clear documentation alongside their code. The documentation should include:
An explanation of how their blockchain works, including details about block creation, transaction validation, and consensus.
Any design decisions they made during the implementation.
Instructions on how to run their blockchain code.
Step 6: Submission and Presentation (10 points)

Students should submit their blockchain code and documentation.
Optionally, you can ask them to give a brief presentation demonstrating their blockchain and explaining how it functions.
Grading Criteria:

Completion of core blockchain components (blocks, transactions, consensus).
Correctness and functionality of the blockchain.
Clarity and completeness of documentation.
Presentation skills and ability to explain the blockchain's operation.
Testing and verification of the blockchain's behavior.
