Blockchain Use Case Analysis

Objective: To identify real-world applications of blockchain technology.

Task: Provide students with a list of industries (e.g., supply chain, healthcare, finance) and ask them to select one. They should research and present a use case within that industry where blockchain technology can provide significant benefits. The presentation should include details on the problem being addressed, the blockchain solution, and potential advantages.

Instructions:

Step 1: Industry Selection (10 points)

Present a list of industries to the students (e.g., supply chain, healthcare, finance, voting systems, intellectual property). Each student should choose one industry for their assignment.
Step 2: Research and Use Case Selection (30 points)

Students should conduct research on their chosen industry to identify a specific problem or challenge that can be addressed using blockchain technology.
Encourage them to explore industry-specific issues and consider how blockchain can provide solutions.
Instruct students to select a use case within their chosen industry that demonstrates the potential of blockchain technology. For example, in the supply chain industry, they might choose to focus on traceability of products using blockchain.
Step 3: Blockchain Solution (30 points)

Students should research and present the blockchain solution for the selected use case. This should include:
Explanation of how blockchain technology can be applied to address the identified problem.
Details about the type of blockchain (public, private, consortium) and consensus mechanism suitable for the use case.
Information on the architecture and components of the blockchain solution.
Step 4: Advantages (20 points)

Students should highlight the potential advantages of implementing the blockchain solution. This can include:
Increased transparency and trust.
Enhanced security and data integrity.
Improved efficiency and reduced costs.
Elimination of intermediaries.
Other industry-specific benefits.
Step 5: Presentation (20 points)

Students should create a presentation (e.g., PowerPoint, Google Slides) that effectively communicates their research findings.
The presentation should include clear explanations, diagrams, and examples.
Encourage students to practice their presentation skills to ensure clarity and engagement.
Step 6: Q&A and Discussion (10 points)

After each presentation, facilitate a Q&A session or class discussion where students can ask questions and provide feedback to their peers. Encourage critical thinking and analysis.
Grading Criteria:

Industry and use case selection.

Depth of research and understanding of the problem.

Clarity and effectiveness of the presentation.

Presentation of the blockchain solution.

Explanation of potential advantages.

Engagement and participation during the Q&A or discussion.
