Token Development on NEO

Objective: To create a custom token on the NEO blockchain.

Task: Instruct students to develop a custom token on the NEO platform. They should choose between NEP-5 or NEP-17 token standards and implement the token with specific functionalities. The assignment should include deploying the token on the NEO blockchain and providing documentation on how to interact with it.

Instructions:

Step 1: Choose a Token Standard (10 points)

Ask students to choose between the NEP-5 or NEP-17 token standard for their token development.
NEP-5: Neo Enhancement Proposal 5, a fungible token standard.
NEP-17: Neo Enhancement Proposal 17, a non-fungible token standard.
Step 2: Token Development (30 points)

Instruct students to develop a custom token using their chosen standard. They should implement the following functionalities:
Token creation with a specific name, symbol, and total supply.
Transfer functionality for users to send tokens to each other.
Optional functionalities based on the chosen token standard (e.g., for NEP-17, additional methods to handle non-fungible assets).
Step 3: Smart Contract Deployment (20 points)

Require students to deploy the developed token as a smart contract on the NEO blockchain.
They should use NEO development tools and test networks for deployment and testing purposes.
Ensure that students follow best practices for smart contract deployment, including security considerations.
Step 4: Interactions and Documentation (20 points)

Ask students to provide detailed documentation on how to interact with their custom token.
Documentation should include instructions for:
Creating a NEO wallet (if required).
Checking token balances.
Sending and receiving tokens.
Any additional functionalities specific to their token.
Step 5: Testing (10 points)

Encourage students to thoroughly test their token smart contract on NEO's testnet or other appropriate test environments.
Students should ensure that the token functions as expected and is free from critical bugs or vulnerabilities.
Grading Criteria:

Successful development of a custom token adhering to the chosen NEP standard.
Proper deployment of the token smart contract on the NEO blockchain.
Clarity and completeness of the provided documentation.
Evidence of thorough testing and validation of the token's functionality.
