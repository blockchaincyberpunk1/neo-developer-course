Token Deployment and Usage

Objective: To deploy and utilize the custom token developed in Assignment 1 within the NEO ecosystem.

Task: Instruct students to deploy the custom token they created in Assignment 1 to a testnet or the NEO MainNet. They should then demonstrate how this token can be used within a simple dApp or within the NEO ecosystem. Students should provide a report outlining the deployment process and the dApp's interaction with the token.

Instructions:

Step 1: Token Deployment (40 points)

Guide students through the process of deploying the custom token to the NEO blockchain. They can choose between deploying it to a NEO testnet or the NEO MainNet.
Ensure students follow best practices for deploying tokens, including proper token naming, precision, and compliance with NEP-5 or NEP-17 standards.
Students should include relevant transaction hashes or deployment proof in their report.
Step 2: dApp Integration (40 points)

Instruct students to create a simple decentralized application (dApp) that utilizes the custom token.
The dApp should include features that showcase how the token can be used within the NEO ecosystem. Examples include token transfers, staking, or using the token as a utility within a specific use case.
Encourage students to develop an intuitive user interface for their dApp to demonstrate token interactions effectively.
Step 3: Report (20 points)

Ask students to provide a comprehensive report documenting their token deployment and dApp development.
The report should include:
Details of the token deployment, including the chosen network (testnet or MainNet).
Explanations of how the dApp interacts with the custom token.
Screenshots or code snippets demonstrating token usage within the dApp.
Challenges encountered during deployment and development, and how they were overcome.
Reflections on the potential real-world applications of their custom token and dApp.
Grading Criteria:

Successful deployment of the custom token to the chosen NEO network.
Functionality and usability of the dApp in token interactions.
Quality of the report, including clarity and completeness.
Alignment of the dApp's features with the objective of showcasing token usage within the NEO ecosystem.
