NEO Smart Contract Development (C#)

Objective: To gain hands-on experience in NEO smart contract development using C#.

Task: Provide students with a simple use case (e.g., a token contract) and guide them through the process of creating and deploying a NEO smart contract using C#. Students should submit their code along with explanations of the functions and logic they implemented.

Instructions:

Step 1: Use Case Selection (10 points)

Choose a specific use case for the NEO smart contract. It can be a token contract, a voting system, or any other simple decentralized application (dApp).
Ensure that the use case involves essential smart contract features like state management and transactions.
Step 2: NEO Smart Contract Development (60 points)

Provide students with resources and guidance on setting up the development environment for NEO smart contracts using C#.
Guide them through the process of creating the smart contract code based on the chosen use case.
Encourage students to implement key functions and logic within the smart contract code. These may include functions for transferring tokens, querying balances, or performing other relevant actions.
Make sure they understand and implement proper error handling and validation within the contract.
Step 3: Deployment and Testing (20 points)

Instruct students on how to deploy the developed smart contract to the NEO blockchain (e.g., using NEO Visual DevTracker or NEO-GUI).
Guide them through the process of interacting with the deployed smart contract, such as sending transactions or querying contract state.
Encourage them to test the smart contract thoroughly, providing test cases and sample interactions to validate its functionality.
Step 4: Documentation and Explanations (10 points)

Ask students to provide clear and concise explanations of the functions and logic implemented within the smart contract.
Ensure they document the deployment process, including any configuration or setup required.
Encourage them to explain how the contract can be used and any relevant insights gained during the development process.
Grading Criteria:

Completeness and accuracy of the smart contract code.
Clarity of explanations and documentation.
Thoroughness of testing and validation.
Overall quality and organization of the submission.
