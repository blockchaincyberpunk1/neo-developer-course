NEO Smart Contract Language Exploration

Objective: To explore NEO's smart contract programming languages.

Task: Allow students to choose one of NEO's supported languages for smart contract development (e.g., C# or Python). Ask them to research and write a comparison between the chosen language and another popular blockchain smart contract language (e.g., Solidity for Ethereum). Students should discuss the syntax, features, and advantages of their chosen NEO language.

Instructions:

Step 1: Language Selection (10 points)

Instruct students to choose one of the NEO-supported smart contract languages, such as C# or Python. They should inform you of their choice.
Step 2: Research and Comparison (35 points)

Ask students to research and gather information on the following aspects of their chosen NEO smart contract language:
Syntax: Explain the syntax rules and conventions of the chosen language.
Features: Describe unique features or capabilities that set the NEO language apart.
Advantages: Discuss the advantages and potential use cases of the chosen NEO language in contrast to another blockchain language, such as Solidity for Ethereum.
Step 3: Comparison to a Competing Language (25 points)

Instruct students to choose a popular blockchain smart contract language other than the one they selected for NEO (e.g., Solidity).
Encourage them to compare and contrast their chosen NEO language with the competing language in terms of syntax, features, and suitability for different types of applications.
Step 4: Real-World Examples (15 points)

Ask students to find or create simple code examples in both their chosen NEO language and the competing language to illustrate the syntax and features discussed.
These examples should be concise and focused on demonstrating key differences or advantages.
Step 5: Conclusion and Reflection (15 points)

Request students to summarize their findings and provide a conclusion regarding the strengths and potential limitations of their chosen NEO smart contract language.
Encourage them to reflect on scenarios where their chosen NEO language would be the preferred choice.
Grading Criteria:

Depth of research into the chosen NEO smart contract language.
Clarity and thoroughness of the comparison between the NEO language and a competing language.
Quality and relevance of real-world code examples.
Insightful reflection on the advantages and suitability of the NEO language.
Overall quality and organization of the comparison essay.
