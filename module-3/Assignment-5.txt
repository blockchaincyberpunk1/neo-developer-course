Smart Contract Use Cases

Objective: To explore real-world applications of NEO smart contracts.

Task: Assign students to research and select a specific use case for NEO smart contracts (e.g., tokenization of assets, supply chain management). They should write a detailed report or create a presentation explaining how smart contracts can be applied to solve a real-world problem in their chosen domain. Students should provide examples and potential benefits.

Instructions:

Step 1: Use Case Selection (10 points)

Allow students to choose a specific domain or industry (e.g., real estate, healthcare, gaming) that interests them.
Encourage them to research and identify a real-world problem or inefficiency within the chosen domain.
Step 2: Smart Contract Proposal (20 points)

Instruct students to propose a NEO smart contract solution that addresses the problem they identified.
Guide them in defining the key features and functionalities of the smart contract.
Ensure they describe how the smart contract will interact with users and other entities within the domain.
Step 3: NEO Smart Contract Development (20 points)

Although this assignment does not require students to implement the smart contract, they should provide a high-level overview of how it might be developed.
Encourage them to discuss which NEO features and programming languages (e.g., C#, Python) might be suitable for their proposed smart contract.
Step 4: Use Case Analysis (30 points)

Instruct students to conduct a comprehensive analysis of their chosen use case and smart contract proposal.
Ask them to provide real-world examples of how the smart contract could be applied and the potential benefits it offers.
Ensure they discuss any challenges or limitations that might arise when implementing the smart contract.
Step 5: Report or Presentation (20 points)

Require students to create a detailed report or presentation that effectively communicates their findings.
Emphasize the importance of clear and concise communication of complex ideas.
Encourage them to use visuals, diagrams, or flowcharts to enhance their presentation.
Grading Criteria:

Relevance and significance of the chosen use case.
Clarity and feasibility of the smart contract proposal.
Depth of analysis and understanding of the domain.
Quality of the report or presentation.
